The Awesome CG List! A collection of various resources to learn computer graphics, including books, tutorials, online courses, and more. Name a CG topic, chances are this list contains some stuff about it (if not, it will someday!).

**What is this "computer graphics" stuff?**
Computer Graphics is a sub-field of computer science, that studies how to create images through computers, like games, movies and image editing.

### What is computer graphics?
Computer graphics is a knowledge area about how to create images using computers, to put it simply. Generally this is done by processing data representing information what you want to draw, for example: objects, colors, light. Anything about visual and digital creations have used CG in some way: games, movies, comics, you name it.

### What do I need to know to get started?
Before showing a lot of books, videos, and materials, first you need to know what is bare-minimum to begin with computer graphics. It boils down to two main topics: programming and math. About the programming, learn the basics, it's recommended 
to lear C/C++ as they are used frequently in this area. The stuff you need to know about math can be found in [this tutorial](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/geometry). It teaches you the necessary 
linear algebra and geometry to create CG programs.


### What if I want to learn more advanced stuff?
Assuming you know programming and math, then you can get more practical. It's a good approach to get a project about a topic 
like global illumination, or GPU programming to deepen your knowledge on this area. Examples of projects are: path tracers, 
photon mapping, shader programmind (this one is not necessarily advanced, but complex).

### Very relevant materials
Regardless of your level of proficiency, this sections show excellent resources that are worth noting first, be it because 
their completness, relevance in the field, or any other quality. 


### Books
* [Real-Time Rendering](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Fourth-Tomas-Akenine-M%C3%B6ller/dp/1138627003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540516813&sr=1-1&dpID=51iw1UWKNhL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), by Tomas Akenine-Moller, one of the best on high performance graphical applications, very detailed explanations and contains many examples to illustrate its topics.

* [Physically Based Rendering](https://www.amazon.com/Physically-Based-Rendering-Theory-Implementation/dp/0128006455/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540517251&sr=1-1&keywords=physically+based+rendering), by Matt Pharr, very code-focused book, goes back and forth between theory and its C++ implementations.

* [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://www.amazon.com/Math-Primer-Graphics-Game-Development/dp/1568817231/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540517337&sr=1-1&keywords=3d+math+prime), by Fletcher Dunn, this book gives more focus to the math necessary for game development, this book does not cover topics like global illumination.

* [Ray Tracing from the Ground Up](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/), by Kevin Suffern, guides you through the task of implement a ray tracer, starting with a bare-bones project, and every chapter introduces a new conpect to add to the renderer.

* [Advanced Global Illumination](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Global-Illumination-Philip-Dutre/dp/1568813074/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540517779&sr=1-1&keywords=advanced+global), by Philip Dutre, its focus are fundamentals to understand realistic image synthesis, such as light transport.

* [Realistic Image Synthesis Using Photon Mapping](https://www.amazon.com/Realistic-Synthesis-Mapping-Revised-Paperback/dp/B011DC2J3O/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1540518657&sr=1-1&keywords=photon+mapping), by Henrik Jensen, teaches math and algorithms to implement the photon mapping rendering process. It even has a complete C++ inplementation of the technique!
